# prettyPlotPoint
Plot series of graphic points as scaled point or bar graph

I'm amazed how long it took me to get this to work, even
to the limited extent that it now does.
I needed this functionality (to visualize a series of data points
as a 2-dimensional graph) and couldn't find compact code that
implemented it simply and for Arduino and ESP boards.
So, I developed it.

This is UNRELEASED. You are welcome to use and develop. I would be 
very  interested to learn of any bugs, improvements, enhancements, etc.
